    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <p> This features the rare combo of something that’s rich and decadent, but also fresh and vibrant at the same time. And yes, you can use regular bacon for this, although as I mentioned in the video, bacon is smoked and pancetta is not. Besides deciding on which cured meat, if any, you can also add any other seasonal vegetables to this, just as long as you cook them ahead, or cut them small enough to cook in the pasta water. No matter what you use, I loved the balance between the pancetta, veggies, and herbaceous sauce, and I really do hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy!  </p>
